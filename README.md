my first captcha solver that teached me how captcha solvers work lol


I used YOLO 11 Image Recognition to train a dataset i hand labeled, it took around 300+ (with augmentation) to achieve this rate of succession.

When you send a GET Request to /solve, it automatically creates a captcha, solves the captcha THEN returns the valid captcha token u can use in whatever you want.
